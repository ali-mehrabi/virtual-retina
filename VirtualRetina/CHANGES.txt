Fixes by Emilie Mayer and Jacob Huth on top of Version 2.2.2

INITIALIZATION OF UNITS
========================
git hash: d3cdcad73330fbb69dea87ebce37478830f4f83e

  * In basespikingchannel.cc, if a unit was present in the xml file, it was
    initialized with default values instead of the values of the spiking
    channel.
    Now the behaviour changes, such that the properties of the
    spikingchannel is propagated to all units that are children of this xml
    node.

  * Also the parameter for square and radial sampling schemes to add jitter
    to the position of neurons is not processed.
    The parameter "noise_pos" can now be used as an attribute of rdSampling
    and sqSampling.

IMPLEMENTATION:
==============

* Solved bug with noise integration in IntegratorNeuron_cpm.
  First version, quite ugly: always save the noise added at previous time step,
  to be able add the *difference* between the two at each time step.
  TODO: Switch to a fully event-driven handling of noise, directly in CondNeuron_cpm.

USAGE OF VIRTUAL RETINA:
=======================

- Modified the general architecture of the retina_package. Executables
  are now stored in VirtualRetina/bin/. Experiments/ are now stored
  in a separate directory outside of VirtualRetina. Etc.

- Totally removed the obsolete <undershoot-version> of the 
  <outer-plexiform-layer>. The undershoot is now added as a subfield of
  the <linear-version> (see EXAMPLE_cat_X_cell.xml).

- Modified implementation of retinal spikingChannels, and associated
  single units (object "OneCell"). As a result, the XML definition files
  for the <spiking-channel> parts have slightly changed (see EXAMPLE 
  retina files).
  Also, the cells' positions are now given in degrees (instead of pixels).
  
- Added a new functionality for normalization in reconstruction from spike
  trains (option -dn 2 in ReconstructRetina, now the default), leading to
  much nicer reconstructions.
  
  
IMPLEMENTATION:
==============

- Modified #includes for compatibility with gcc version 4.3

- Updated to xmlParameters++ version 1.1.1 (with direct use of libxml2 
  instead of c++ wrapper libxml++).
  
- Updated to CImg 1.3.4
  
- Solved bug in Retina::adjustSizes() : When using as input a 
  file "retina.xml" produced by a previous call to program Retina,
  the new retina produced (and new saved "retina.xml") could display
  a different number of cells in its spiking channels.
  
- Solved bug in <square-array> of spiking cells. Now, an array with a
  single spiking cell has the cell centered in (0,0), as it should.
  
- Changed implementation of ExpCascade in BaseRecFilter (to gain
  stability). Also, added graphical test of BaseRecFilter impulse 
  responses: functions testImpulseResponse() and testIntegratedResponse(). 

- various small code modifications and fixes...




*************************************************************************
************                 VERSION 2.1                *****************
************            (July 07 -> April 10)           *****************
*************************************************************************


10-30-2007 :

-------> NEW XML NAMES:
		* in the OPL, 'adaptation-version' is replaced by 'undershoot-version'.
		  corresponding parameters 'adap-***' replaced by 'undershoot-***'

		* at the contrast gain control stage, all names in '**-amacrine**'
		  are replaced by their equivalent '**-adaptation**',
		  accounting for the biological origin of the fast contrast adaptation 
		  modeled here, which is very likely NOT amacrine cells.


10-12-2007 :

-------> SQUARE ARRAY OF SPIKING CELLS: Bug fixed in the sqSpikingChannel (square array of
	 spiking cells), which did not correctly place the spiking cells in the image.


08-21-2007 : 

-------> improved signal representations (cimg_signal_drawer.h and .cc),
	 with real handling of log scales. Corresponding modifications in src/appli executables


08-08-2007 : NEW PACKAGE ONLINE (version 2.1), with

-------> new file architecture (External_Libraries vs VirtualRetina).

-------> Old, rudimentary Makefile replaced by an installation with CMake.

-------> a VirtualRetina/local/ directory is created, with all required bin/ and lib/

-------> Thorough tutorial in pdf, explaining installation, usage and underlying model.

-------> All spatial xml parameters expressed in visual degrees.

-------> Simpler xml names for the different parameters.

-------> Possibility of automatic download and installation of all required libraries,
         with the shell scipt download_build_all.sh


08-06-2007 : Happy birthday Tim

07-24-2007 :

-------> Changed names of the microsaccade generator

-------> Solved numeration bug in Retina_main.cc (size of input_CP , lign 364)


07-19-2007 :

-------> Default synaptic function for the contrast-gain-control
	is taken by default as	
		 V -> V^2
	instead of the old synaptic function
		 V -> pos_part(V-v0) + pos_part(-V-v0)
	used before that.
	You can use <contrast-gain-control-custom>, to have more liberty
	on the choice of the synaptic function.


-------> Change in the xml names for the GANGLION layers :
	the obsolete 'parvocellular-ganglion-layer' and 
	'magnocellular-ganglion-layer' are now replaced by the simple:
	
	'ganglion-layer'.

	But the former names still work.




03-2007 :

-------> All parameters used in the xml definition file are now 
	followed by the unit in which they are expressed.
	example:
		temporal-step is replaced by temporal-step__sec


-------> All spatial parameters are now expressed in visual degrees
	 rather than pixels as before

-------> A pixel/degree conversion is created.

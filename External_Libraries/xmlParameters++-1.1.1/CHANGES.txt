************** VERSION 1.1.1

This is the second version (1.1.1) of the library. As compared to the first
version (1.0), we have:

 * Stopped using library libxml++ (a C++ wrapper for the standard GNU library
   libxml2 in C), using libxml2 directly instead (so that potential users need
   not install the relatively useless libxml++).
   
 * Changed some class names ('xmlClass' becomes 'Xmlizable') and function
   names ('xmlRegister' becomes 'Register'), and added all classes and functions
   in a single namespace 'xmlParam'.
   
 * Added a number of warnings.
 
 * Reshaped the library, removing some almost useless headers.
 
 * Fixed some internal bugs related to handling of memory for pointers and
   containers (see 'General note on inclusion in the XML structure' at the end
   of the README).

 * Fixed a bug which prevented from correct 'xmlization' of objects using
   virtual inheritance (see third note in 'implementation issues' at the end
   of the README).

 * Added two functionalities: Functions to retrieve XML names (see README: 
   'Retrieving an object's XML name'), and the possibility of applying a custom 
   initialization to an object, right after its parameters have been loaded 
   from an xml file (see README: 'Custom initialization after XML load').

 * Changed the make/installation process (create .a and .so libraries,
   and added a 'make install' procedure).
